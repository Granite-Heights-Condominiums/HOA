Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Owner shall have the right to supervise the redecorating work in his own Unit.

2. **Procedure for Reconstruction and Repair.**

    (a) Immediately after a fire or other casualty causing damage to a Unit or improvement within the Common or Limited Common Area, the Board of Directors shall obtain reliable and detailed estimates of the cost of repairing and restoring the damage to a condition as good as that existing before such casualty. Such costs may also include professional fees and premiums for such bonds as the Board of Directors determines to be necessary. The Board shall contract for such repair and restoration and in doing so shall exercise its sole discretion in selecting from among said estimates.

    (b) **Improvements in Common and/or Limited Common Area.** If the proceeds of insurance, paid to the Board as trustee for the owners and their mortgagees pursuant to Sections 1 and 3 of Article VI hereof, are not sufficient to defray the said estimated costs of reconstruction and repair, or upon completion of reconstruction and repair, the funds for the payment of the costs thereof are insufficient, assessments in sufficient additional amounts to provide payment of such costs shall be made against the owners in proportion to their respective Percentage Interest as defined in the Declaration. If all or any portion of such assessments are not available to the Board prior to the time that the amounts thereof are needed to provide payment of such costs, the Board may borrow such amounts, on behalf of the Association, and may secure such borrowing by assignment of the liens relative thereto arising pursuant to Section 2 of Article XII of these Bylaws.

    (c) **Improvements in Units.** If the proceeds of insurance, paid to the Board as Trustee for the Owners and their mortgagees pursuant to Section 3 of Article VI. hereof, are not sufficient to defray the estimated costs of reconstruction and repair a Unit, or upon completion of reconstruction and repair of a Unit, the funds for the payment of the costs thereof are insufficient, the Owner of said Unit shall be required to provide the Board with such additional amounts necessary to pay said costs prior to commencement of reconstruction and repair of the Unit. If said payment is not forthcoming by the Owner within thirty (30) days of notice by the Board of said insufficiency, an assessment as provided in Declaration may be made against the owner in a sufficient additional amount to provide payment of such costs related to said Owner's Unit.

    (d) Any such reconstruction or repair shall be substantially in accordance with the original plans and specifications under which the damaged building was originally constructed.

    (e) Encroachments upon or in favor of Units which may be created as a result of such reconstruction or repair shall not constitute a claim or basis for any proceeding or action by the Owner upon whose property such encroachment exists, provided that such reconstruction is substantially in accordance with original plans and specifications under which the damaged building was originally constructed. Such encroachments shall be allowed to continue in existence for so long as the building (as reconstructed) shall stand.

3. **Disbursements of Construction Funds.**

    (a) The net proceeds of insurance collected on account of a casualty and any additional amounts collected by the Board of Directors from assessments against Owners on account of such casualty (or borrowed by the Board as provided in Section 2(b)(1) above) shall constitute a construction fund which shall be disbursed in payment of the cost of reconstruction and repair by the Board of Directors.

    (b) The construction fund shall be paid by the Board of Directors in appropriate progress payments, to such contractors, suppliers and personnel engaged in performing the work or supplying materials or services for the repair and reconstruction as are designated by the Board of Directors.

    (c) It shall be presumed that the first monies disbursed in payment of the cost of reconstruction and repair shall be from insurance proceeds; and if there is a balance in the construction fund after the payment of all the cost of the reconstruction and repair for which the fund is established, such balance shall first be applied to any improvements pursuant to Section 2(b) (1) above, and the remainder, if any; shall be distributed to the Owners in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

    (d) When the damage is to both Common Area and Units, the insurance proceeds shall to the extent practical, be applied first to the cost of repairing the Common Area, second the Limited Common Area and the balance to the cost of repairing the Units.

## ARTICLE VIII
### SALES, LEASES, AND ALIENATION OF UNITS

1. **No Severance of Ownership.** No Owner shall execute any deed, lease, mortgage, or instrument conveying or mortgaging the title to his Unit without including therein the Percentage Interest of such Unit in the Common Area, it being the intention hereof to prevent any severance of such combined ownership. Any such deed, lease, mortgage, or other instrument purporting to affect such title or one or more of such interests, without including all such title or interests, shall be deemed and taken to include the title or interests so omitted, even though the latter shall not be expressly mentioned or described therein. Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided by the Declaration, these Bylaws or the Condominium Act, the Percentage Interest in the Common Area allocated to any Unit shall not be altered and any purported transfer, encumbrance, or other disposition of that interest without the Unit to which it appertains shall be void.

2. **Payment of Assessments.** No Owner shall be permitted to convey, mortgage, sell, lease, give, or devise his Unit unless and until he (or his personal representative) shall have paid in full to the Board of Directors all unpaid Common Expense theretofore assessed by the Board of Directors with respect to his Unit, and shall have satisfied all unpaid liens with respect to his Unit, except mortgages. Where this provision is satisfied at the time of execution of a mortgage, there shall be no requirement that it again be satisfied at the time of a subsequent foreclosure of such mortgage, or deed in lieu of such foreclosure. In the event that the Unit is subject to outstanding assessments previously levied against such Unit, and the acquiring Owner or the transferring Owner requests a recordable statement pursuant to Section 3 of Article V, the statement shall expressly state any waiver of, or failure or refusal to exercise, the right of the Association to prevent the disposition of such Unit, in any case where such waiver, failure or refusal may exist. Failure or refusal to furnish such a statement as provided in said Section 3 shall not only constitute a waiver of such assessment but also make the above-mentioned prohibition inapplicable to any such disposition of the Unit.


## ARTICLE IX

## ARTICLE X
### MORTGAGES

1. **Notice of Default.** The Board shall give written notice to an Owner of any default by the Owner in the performance of any obligations under the Act, Declaration or Bylaws. No suit or other proceeding may be brought to foreclose the lien for any assessment levied pursuant to the Declaration or these Bylaws except after ten (10) days' written notice to the holder of the first mortgage on the unit which is the subject matter of such suit or proceeding provided the Board has been given notice of such mortgage in the manner set forth in Paragraph 8(g) of the Declaration.

1. **Manner of Notice.** Except as otherwise provided in the Declaration and these Bylaws, all notices, demands, bills, statements or other communications provided for or required under these Bylaws shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally or if sent by U.S. Mail, first class postage prepaid, (i) if to an Owner, at the address of his Unit and at such other address as the Owner may have designated by notice in writing to the secretary, or (ii) if to the Association, the Board of Directors or the Manager, at the Condominium or at such other address as shall be designated by notice in writing to the Owners pursuant to this Section.

2. **Waiver of Notice.** Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of the statutes, the Declaration or of these Bylaws, a waiver thereof, in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether signed before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto, unless such waiver is ineffective under the provisions of the Condominium Act.


## ARTICLE XII
### COMPLIANCE AND DEFAULT

1. **Relief.** Each Owner shall be governed by, and shall comply with, all of the terms of the Declaration, these Bylaws, and the Rules, and any amendments of the same. A default by an Owner shall entitle the Association acting through the Board of Directors or the Manager, to the following relief:

    (a) **Legal Proceedings.** Failure to comply with any of the terms of the Declaration, these Bylaws, and the Rules shall be grounds for relief which may include without limiting the same, an action to recover any sums due for money damages, injunctive relief, foreclosure of the lien for payment of all assessments, any other relief provided for in these Bylaws, or any combination thereof, and any other relief afforded by a court of competent jurisdiction, all of which relief may be sought by the Association, the Board of Directors, the Manager, or, if appropriate, by an aggrieved owner.

    (b) **Additional Liability.** Each Owner shall be liable for the expenses of all maintenance, repair or replacement rendered necessary by his acts, neglect or carelessness or the act, neglect or carelessness of any member of his family or his tenants, guests, employees, agents or invitees, but only to the extent that such expense is not covered by the proceeds of insurance carried by the Board of Directors. Such liability shall include any increase in insurance rates occasioned by use, misuse, occupancy or abandonment of any Unit or its appurtenances. Nothing contained herein, however, shall be construed as modifying any waiver by an insurance company of its rights of subrogation.

    (c) **Costs and Attorneys Fees.** In any proceeding arising out of any alleged default by an Owner, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover the costs of the proceeding, and such reasonable attorneys’ fees as may be determined by the court.

    (d) **No Waiver of Rights.** The failure of the Association, the Board of Directors, or of an Owner to enforce any right, provision, covenant, or condition which may be granted by the Declaration, these Bylaws or the Rules shall not constitute a waiver of the right of the Association, the Board of Directors, or any Owner to enforce such right, provision, covenant, or condition in the future. All rights, remedies and-privileges granted to the Association, the Board of Directors, or any Owner pursuant to any term, provision, covenant or condition of the Declaration, these Bylaws or the Rules shall be deemed to be cumulative and the exercise of any one or more thereof shall not be deemed to constitute an election of remedies, nor shall it preclude the party exercising the same from exercising such privileges as may be granted to such party by the Declaration, these Bylaws or the Rules, or at law or in equity.

    (e) **Interest.** In the event of a default by any owner against him which continues for a period in excess of thirty (30) days, such Owner shall be obligated to pay interest in the amounts due at the highest rate permitted by law, or at eighteen percent (18 %), whichever is less, per annum from the due date thereof. In addition, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to impose a late payment charge on such defaulting Owner in an amount not to exceed five percent (5 %) on any amount so overdue.

    (f) **Abatement and Enjoinment of Violations by Owners.** The violation of any rule or regulation adopted by the Board of Directors, or the breach of any Bylaw contained herein, or the breach of any provision of the Declaration, shall give the Board of Directors or the Manager the right, in addition to any other rights set forth in these Bylaws:

        (i) to enter the Unit in which, or as to which, such violation or breach exists and summarily to abate and remove, at the expense of the defaulting owner, any structure, thing or condition that may exist therein contrary to the intent and meaning of provisions hereof, and the Board of Directors or Manager shall not thereby be deemed guilty in any manner of trespass;

        (ii) to enjoin, abate or remedy by appropriate legal proceedings, either at law or in equity, the continuance of any such breach; or

        (iv) to suspend or limit the right of the Owner committing the violation to use any part of the Common Area during the continuance of such violation.

2. **Lien for Assessments.**

    (a) The total annual assessment of each Owner for the Common Expense or any special assessment levied pursuant to these Bylaws is hereby declared to be a lien levied against the Unit of such Owner as provided in the Condominium Act (including without limitation the priority provisions set forth in Section 46 thereof) which lien shall be effective when perfected in accordance with said Act.

    (b) In any case where an assessment against an owner is payable in installments, upon a default by such Owner in the payment of any single installment, which continues for ten (10) days after written notice of such default has been sent to the Owner, the maturity of the remaining unpaid installments of such assessment may be accelerated, at the option of the Board of Directors, and the then balance owing may be declared due and payable in full by the service of notice to such effect upon the defaulting owner by the Board of Directors or Manager. The Association, in order to perfect such lien shall file before the expiration of six (6) months from the time that the delinquent assessment (or installment, where such assessment is payable in installments) became due and payable, a memorandum in the Registry in form and manner prescribed in said Act.

    (c) The lien for assessments shall include interest, late charge, costs and attorneys’ fees as provided in Section 1 of this Article XII and may be foreclosed in the manner provided by the laws of the State of New Hampshire for the foreclosure of power of sale mortgages or by suit brought in the name of the Board of Directors, acting on behalf of the Association. During the pendancy of such proceedings or suit, the Owner shall be required to pay a reasonable rental for the Unit for any period prior to sale pursuant to any judgmert or order of any court having jurisdiction over such sale.

    (d) Suit to recover a money judgment for unpaid assessments shall be maintainable without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing the same, and foreclosure shall be available without bringing suit to recover a money judgment.

## ARTICLE XIV
### COMPLIANCE, CONFLICT, AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

1. **Compliance.** These Bylaws are set forth in compliance with the requirements of the Condominium Act.

2. **Severability.** If any provisions of these Bylaws or Rules or any section, sentence, clause, phrase, or word, or the application thereof in any circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of these Bylaws and Rules shall not be affected thereby and to this end, the provisions hereof are declared to be severable.

3. **Waiver.** No provision contained in this Declaration shall be deemed to have been abrogated or waived by any failure to enforce the same (except where a right is dependent upon the notice to be given within a specified period), irrespective of the number of violations or breaches which may occur.

4. **Captions.** The captions contained in these Bylaws are for convenience only and are not part of these Bylaws and are not intended in any way to limit or enlarge the terms and provisions of these Bylaws.
