The Board is hereby irrevocably appointed the agent for each Owner of a Unit and for each mortgagee of a Unit and for each Owner of any other interest in the Condominium to submit and adjust all claims arising under such policy, or otherwise resulting from such damage, and to execute and deliver releases upon the payment of claims. Any deficiency between the costs of repair or restoration and any insurance proceeds available to pay therefore shall be assessed against the Owners by the Association as a Common Expense.

### X. Invalidity
It is the intention of the Declarant that the Condominium Instruments are severable, so that if any provision, condition, covenant or restriction hereof shall be invalid or void under any applicable law or ordinance, the remainder shall be unaffected thereby. If any such provision is void, voidable or unenforceable at the time of recording hereof, the Declarant, for itself, its successors and assigns, whether as Declarant or Owner, covenant and agree to that any amendments or supplements to any such law or ordinance having the effect of removing said invalidity, voidability, or unenforceability, shall be deemed to apply retrospectively to the Condominium Instruments thereby validating the same as if originally incorporated therein.

### Y. Waiver
No provision of the Condominium Instruments shall be deemed waived or abrogated by failure to enforce the same (except where a right is conditioned upon the giving of notice within a specified time), regardless of the number or character of breaches.

### Z. Right to Relocate or Remove Units
The Declarant expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to be exercised from time to time prior to the completion of any Unit(s) which may be removed or relocated pursuant to this subparagraph Y, by the recording of one or more amendments to the Condominium Instruments, to remove any such incomplete Unit(s) from the Condominium, or to relocate any such Unit(s) (and any appurtenant Limited Common Area,) to (an)other location(s) within the Condominium; and, as appropriate to or required by such removal or relocation, to modify the design, layout and location of roads, walkways, driveways, utilities and similar improvements and appurtenances.
