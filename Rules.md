## 2.1 Satellite Dishes
The Granite Heights does allow satellite dishes, in accordance with the FCC rules. Dishes may be installed on the Limited Common Areas only, which includes the rear deck floor or deck railing. Dishes cannot be installed on or in the Common Areas, or on any part of the unit except as noted. The satellite dish cannot exceed one (1) meter in diameter, and cannot extend beyond the vertical (top of the slider) or horizontal (deck railing) planes of the deck surface. Nonconforming dishes will be removed by the Association, at the homeowner's expense. Satellite dishes cannot be mounted on towers, or attached directly to the units. All cables must go in the basement and be installed in a professional manner.
The Owner will be responsible for all costs associated with the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system. No trees or branches may be removed to facilitate installation. Any removal of such will result in a fine of $100 to the unit, as well as any other restitution costs deemed necessary by the Board. The Owner will be responsible to remove the dish so the Association can conduct routine maintenance on the decks or structures when required. The Association will notify the owner in writing, and allow 48 hours for removal of the dish. If the owner does not remove the dish, the Association has the right to remove the dish, and will not be responsible for damage or the cost to install it after maintenance has been conducted. The Association will not be responsible for any damage due to falling objects, including trees, branches, ice from roofs, or any other items. The Owner will be responsible for any and all damage to the decks, rails, or any other part of the structure during installation or removal of the satellite dishes.
Homeowners wishing to install a satellite dish must first request permission, in writing, to the Board prior to installing a dish. The request must include dish diameter and location on the deck, along with a simple wiring diagram. The Board requires notification at least seven (7) days prior to installing the dish, and the owner must receive approval before any work begins.

## 5.0 Rear Deck Awning
The installation of rear deck awning must be pre-approved by the Board of Directors by submitting a request in writing, and must meet all standards and specifications. (I.e. SunSetter Vista crank out or standard Motorized models, Forest Green or Evergreen solid color only (no exceptions) – widths may vary according to deck dimensions).
Homeowners are responsible for all costs associated with the purchase, installation, re-installation, maintenance, and removal of the awnings. The awning can only be originally installed by a contractor approved by the Board of Directors, or a contractor recommended by SunSetter.
Homeowners are also responsible for any damage to the existing structures associated with the awning. Awnings must be removed and re-installed by the homeowner, or by a Board approved contractor at the owner’s expense within 3 business days when requested by the Board for the purpose of building maintenance. If the unit owner doesn’t comply within the specified time, the Board has the right to contract for removal at the unit owner’s expense. If the Board is forced to remove an awning the Board of Directors, Granite Heights Condominium Association, or their Agent will not be responsible for any damage to the awning, or replacement of the awning.
The awning cannot protrude beyond the side or front handrails of that unit owner’s rear deck. Unit owners are not permitted to remove any light fixtures, vents, siding, or any other exterior portion of the building or decking, during the installation process.
All awnings must be removed or stored properly during the winter months, November 15th through April 15th, each and every year. The awning owner will be responsible for all damage to the buildings, common areas, and other owner’s personal property in the event that the awning or any portion thereof falls from, is blown from, or for any other reason causes any damage.
Unit owners are responsible for maintain the awning at all times. In the event the awning is not being maintained to the Board’s acceptable level, the Board has the right to order removal of the awning, at the unit owner’s expense, and give 24 hours for the unit owner to comply. If the unit owner doesn’t comply within the specified time, the Board has the right to contract for removal at the unit owner’s expense.
If the Board is forced to remove an awning, the Board of Directors, Granite Heights Condominium Association, or their Agent will not be responsible for any damage to the awning, or replacement of the awning. Under no circumstance will awnings be considered any portion of the unit or limited common areas for the purpose of insurance coverage, and will be deemed unit owner’s personal property at all times.

## Enforcement
A. The Board shall have the authority to enforce all Rules. Such enforcement will include warnings and levying assessments against violators of these rules. A first offense violation will result in a written or verbal warning from the Board or Management. Subsequent infraction of the same rule within a 12-month period will result in an assessment of $100. A Resident receiving an assessment has the right to appear at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting to show cause why the assessment should not be paid. Failure to pay such an assessment within thirty (30) days will lead to a 10% late payment charge. Nothing herein shall be construed to limiting the Condominium Owners Association from other remedies available to them under the Bylaws or other Condominium Documents.
